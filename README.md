As part of my hands-on learning in machine learning, I built a real estate price prediction web application. This project uses Python for model development and Flask for backend integration.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, NumPy for data processing

Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation (Linear Regression)

Flask for building the web interface

HTML/CSS for frontend

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Clean data preprocessing with outlier removal and feature engineering

Trained a linear regression model to predict house prices

Developed a Flask-based web interface where users can input property features (location, BHK, sqft) to get predicted prices

Hosted locally with modular, production-ready code structure

ðŸ”¹ Outcome:

Gained end-to-end experience of converting a Jupyter notebook model into a deployable web app

Learned the importance of clean data, one-hot encoding, and pipeline structure for ML deployment
